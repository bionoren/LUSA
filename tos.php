LUSA SE: Brief History
<br>
LUSA was originally built by LeTourneau students in 2000 as a software systems class project. The students graduated and left LUSA in the
<br>
hands of IT, who do not appear to have touched it since. This is a student effort to update the LUSA concept into something more useful and user-friendly.
